# 🧮 My Calculator Web App

This is a small calculator project I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I made this mainly to practice front‑end basics and understand how UI and JavaScript logic work together.

The calculator supports basic operations and includes a clean, soft‑shadow (neumorphism) style that I designed myself.
